# 2D_Semi-infinite_PhC

This code implements an efficient eigensolver for calculating isolated eigenvalues and the corresponding eigenvectors for 2D semi-infinite and bi-infinite photonic crystals. The numerical method is introduced in the manuscript "A Contour Integral-Based Method for Nonlinear Eigenvalue Problems for Semi-Infinite Photonic Crystals" by Xing-Long Lyu, Tiexiang Li and Wen-Wei Lin.
